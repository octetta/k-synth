# Statement of Authorship & Process

### 🏛️ Architectural Origin
**k/synth** is conceived and directed by Joseph Stewart aka **octetta**.
The engine’s defining constraints—its right-associative logic, one-letter
variable limit, and strict `\p` variable-only playback—were designed to
explore the intersection of minimalist math and sound design.

### 🤖 The Collaborative Process
The implementation was realized through a **conceptual dialogue** between
a human architect and an agentic development tool (AI-assisted pair
programming). 

**The Human-in-the-Loop Workflow:**
* **Human Direction**: Defining the engine's "Base Camp" philosophy and high-level DSP goals.
* **AI Synthesis**: Translating those goals into C and K-inspired syntax under strict oversight.
* **Iterative Validation**: A feedback loop where octetta tested, broke, and refined the logic.

By documenting this process, we assert that the creative labor and
architectural decisions reside with the human author, while acknowledging
the tool used for fabrication.
